EXPANSION model for Type Ia Supernova Light Curve Fitting

Here we present both the training and the testing of the EXPANSION model, this model proposes a modification in the Type Ia Supernova flux empirically derived in SALT2 (Spectral Adaptive Light Curve Template 2, see Betoule 2014).  

We present the pre-processing steps applied to the SNFactory data used to create our templates. We also present our templates, a validation fit and a Light Curve fitting of the Pantheon Sample (Scolnic, 2018), followed by a cosmological analysis comparing our constraining power with SALT2's over the same sample, yet without considering distance bias corrections.
